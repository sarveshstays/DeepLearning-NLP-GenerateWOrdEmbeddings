On XXXX XXXX XX/XX/2015 I received offer from US bank to apply Cash plus Visa Signature card. After a lit bit thoughts i decided to apply as i did not have any relationship with US BANK and wanted to start because the card had a lot of reward and other perks. After applying my application went directly to FRAUD department which was really very weird and i surprised for me. making long story short i contacted Us bank and was Welcomed by VERY RUDE Disrespectful person name XXXX XXXX who was from beginning start accusing me that i will take this card spend and never pay them back even though i have VERY exceptional credit and I 'm very responsible borrower having just used 2 percent of my total available credit NEVER been Late and doing all my best to Never have any delinquent or negative mark in my credit. XXXX XXXX start making assumptions that im high risk that i have available credit and and because i do n't have balance XXXX day i might take all credit available to me spend and never pay back. I have great job great credit and i was treated very very biased and i do n't afraid use word maybe even discriminated. I ask him politely to speak to supervisor and he did n't wanted to transfer by saying on behalf of supervisor that supposedly he would tell me same thing but after me pressing him he finally transfered me where i left message and never got all back. Couple days later i received this letter the reasons of my application denial which is completely false all reasons. i attached to see all of them and also im happy to send my updated credit bureau with XXXX XXXX which shos i have VERY EXCEPTIONAL CREDIT the same credit which they rated XXXX score XXXX they denied me credit based on all false injustice reasons. Im giving my consent to please investigate and know the TRUE on my behalf dear Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. All this process was VERY UNFAIR BIASED AND IM SURE I WILL CLEAR MY NAME BECAUSE MY CREDIT CARD APPLICATION WAS NOT SUPPOSE TO BE IN FRAUD DEPARTMENT IN FIRST PLACE. Please assist me to find justice and to credit equal access to credit based not on any type of XXXX religion or national origination but based on facts and the facts are i have as i stated very exceptional credit great job and income and still my application goes to fraud department for no resaon. thank you very much\",\n",
